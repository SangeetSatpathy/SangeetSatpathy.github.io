<h2> Robotics Intern (Personal Project) | <a href="https://www.reubotics.com/#/interns/">Reubotics</a>, Millbrae, CA		         				      </h2>

<h3> November 2023 - Present</h3>
1. Designed (using Onshape's CAD software), assembled, machined, and programmed a Robot with the guidance of the Robotics Subject Matter Expert, Dr. Reuben Brewer. 
The purpose of the robot is to detect, pick up, and sort trash lying on the road. <br>

2. Used Dynamixel AX-18A and XC-330 Motors for this project. Setup communication to motors through the Pyserial module, given the packet length, instruction packets, parity, etc.
<br>3. Parts used in the robot included 8mm shafts, flanged ball bearings, clamping shaft collars, shims, and an assortment of socket head screws. Tools used included Allen wrenches, hand taps, reamers, and a hand drill. All main parts were 3-D printed on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon printer.
<br>4. Stress-tested the design in the CAD software (Onshape) and calculated expected torque on the motor. This was used to make the gear ratios torque-oriented.
 <br>5. Cut, re-lengthened, and soldered wires in order to make the wires fit my design.
<br>6. Wrote a program using Computer Vision concepts to train a custom Machine Learning Model (YOLOv5 Object Detection Model) to help the Robot "track" and detect the plastic bottle and move towards it.
<br><br>
Skills: Design, CAD, Kinematics, Trigonometry, Python, Computer Vision


<h2>Radio Frequency (Wireless Networks) Engineering Intern  | <a href="https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/">Verizon</a>     
   <br> (Through the <a href="https://naf.org/our-academies/career-pathways/academy-of-engineering/">NAF Academy of Engineering internship</a> program)               </h2>
<h3>Jun 2024 – July 2024</h3>
1. Analyzed the performance of Verizon's 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Products (on C-band) in several counties in Northern California. Verizon's Fixed Wireless Access product,
 also known as 5G Home Internet, provides 5G internet access without needing a cabled connection to one's house.
<br>2.Troubleshooted and resolved issues such as slow internet speeds, high drop rates, and radio frequency 
interference at 5G sites, which resulted in better Internet experiences for customers. 
Issues can include an incorrectly built cell site, an overshooting antenna tilt, or a synchronization issue.
<br>3. Worked on the steps that go into planning, building, and maintaining a cell site. 
These include cell site design (simulating antenna coverage based on power, height, and azimuth), power regulation, safety inspection (Electromagnetic Exposure), municipal engagement, and system performance.
 Also learnt about the difference between 5G SA (Standalone) and 5G NSA (Non Stand Alone), TDD (Time Division Duplexing) vs. FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing), Cell Site Guard Periods, as well as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
<br>4. This internship was for 6 weeks (32 hours per week).


<h2> Curriculum Lead, Machinist, CAD Designer | <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/'>Gunn Robotics Team (GRT) </a>, Palo Alto, CA         			      </h2>
<h3> Aug 2023 - Present</h3>
The Gunn Robotics Team (FRC 192), is a completely student-run team that participates in the annual First Robotics Competition Challenge.
<br>As a Curriculum Lead for the <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/summer'>2024 GRT Summer Camp </a>, I developed the curriculum for the camp. This included making a list of concepts and developing robotics challenges for the participants to learn from.

Additionally, as a member in the team, I help in brainstorming, designing, CAD-ing, machining, assembling, and programming the robot. <br>
Furthermore, in October, the team hosts a "haunted house" for a local elementary school. For this, I design, CAD, and machine wooden Halloween-themed mechanisms that are powered by pneumatics.
For machining, I use a variety of tools, including the mill, lathe, vertical bandsaw (wood and metal), horizontal bandsaw, and drill press. 

<br><br> Skills: Design, CAD, Java, Circuitry, Machining

GRT won the <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/IDBO/awards">FIRST Robotics Idaho Regional competition </a> in March 2024

<h2> Computer Vision Research |  Palo Alto, CA		         				       </h2>
<h3>Aug 2023 - Present</h3>
Started this research as part of the <a href="https://aar.pausd.org/"> AAR course </a> and continued doing research  after the class as well. Researched the benefits and setbacks of machine learning models in determining when it is safe for a pedestrian to cross the road. Used this to build an app that utilizes computer vision to detect cars and other obstacles when crossing the road. Model will be deployed on smart devices, such as a “smart hat”.
