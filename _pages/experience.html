<h2> Robotics Personal Project | Reubotics, Palo Alto, CA		         				      </h2>

<h3> November 2023 - Present</h3>
Designed (using CAD), assembled, machined, and programmed a robot with the guidance of the robotics subject matter expert, Dr. Reuben Brewer. 
The robot was made to detect, pick up, and sort trash lying on the road. <br><br> Skills: Design, CAD, Kinematics, Trigonometry, Python, Computer Vision


<h2>Radio Frequency (Wireless Networks) Engineering Intern  | Verizon     (NAF Engineering Intern)               </h2>
<h3>Jun 2024 – July 2024</h3>
1. Analyzed the performance of Verizon's 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Products in several counties in Northern California. Verizon's Fixed Wireless Access product,
 also known as 5G Home Internet, provides 5G internet access without needing a cabled connection to one's house.
<br>2.Troubleshooted and resolved issues such as slow internet speeds, high drop rates, and radio frequency 
interference at 5G sites, which resulted in better Internet experiences for customers. 
Issues can include an incorrectly built cell site, an overshooting antenna tilt, or a synchronization issue.
<br>3. Worked on the steps that go into planning, building, and maintaining a cell site. 
These include antenna design, power regulation, safety inspection (Electromagnetic Exposure), municipal engagement, and system performance.
<br>4. This internship was for 6 weeks (32 hours per week).


<h2> Curriculum Lead, Machinist, CAD Designer | <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/'>Gunn Robotics Team (GRT) </a>, Palo Alto, CA        			      </h2>
<h3> Aug 2023 - Present</h3>
The Gunn Robotics Team (FRC 192), is a completely student-run team that participates in the annual First Robotics Competition Challenge.
<br>As a Curriculum Lead for the <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/summer'>2024 GRT Summer Camp </a>, I developed the curriculum for the camp. This included making a list of concepts and developing robotics challenges for the participants to learn from.

Additionally, as a member in the team, I help in brainstorming, designing, CAD-ing, machining, assembling, and programming the robot. <br>
Furthermore, in October, the team hosts a "haunted house" for a local elementary school. For this, I design, CAD, and machine wooden Halloween-themed mechanisms that are powered by pneumatics.
For machining, I use a variety of tools, including the mill, lathe, vertical bandsaw (wood and metal), horizontal bandsaw, and drill press. 

<br><br> Skills: Design, CAD, Java, Circuitry, Machining

<br><br>
GRT won the <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/IDBO/awards">FIRST Robotics Idaho Regional competition </a> in March 2024

<h2> Computer Vision Research |  Palo Alto, CA		         				       </h2>
<h3>Aug 2023 - Present</h3>
Started this research as part of the <a href="https://aar.pausd.org/"> AAR course </a> and continued doing research  after the class as well. Researched the benefits and setbacks of machine learning models in determining when it is safe for a pedestrian to cross the road. Used this to build an app that utilizes computer vision to detect cars and other obstacles when crossing the road. Model will be deployed on smart devices, such as a “smart hat”.

<h2>IoT (Internet-of-Things) Engineering Intern  | Verizon     (NAF Engineering Intern)               </h2>
<h3>Jun 2023 – July 2023</h3>
1. Worked on Verizon ThingSpace IoT management platform, that gives external organizations all the tools to build IoT solutions to solve business problems. 
<br>2. Worked on the Connectivity Management APIs, including the REST APIs. The APIs handle the direct management over the devices, including adding and removing IoT devices to the network, checking their status, and monitoring their usage. 
<br>3. Worked with various IoT technologies, including radio communicators (such as modems, modules, and chipsets). 
<br>4. Additionally, I was exposed to the LTE-MBB and LTE-MTC cellular networks and their applicability to IoT.
