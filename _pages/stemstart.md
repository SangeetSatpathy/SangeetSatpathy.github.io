I am the founder of the non-profit <a href="https://stem-start.org">STEMStart!</a> 

STEMStart! began as my Eagle Scout project, but has continued beyond. STEMStart! has partnered with different organizations to come in and teach elementary, middle and high school kids about STEM through multiple **free, hands-on** workshops (8 workshops thus far!). STEMStart! has ensured that its workshops are accessible to students with demographics and backgrounds that are underprivileged and under-represented in STEM. The workshops are free and over weekends, with food provided. 

The workshop topics have included:
- Bee-keeping & Ecosystems (1 workshop)
- Linkages (1 workshop)
- Hydraulics (1 workshop)
- Nuclear Science (1 workshop)
- Electrical Engineering and Circuitry (4 workshops)

 STEMStart! has partnered with <a href="https://www.planetbee.org/">Planet Bee</a>, <a href="https://lawrencehallofscience.org/">UC Berkeley Lawrence Hall of Science</a>, and Subject Matter Experts in Electrical Engineering and Nuclear Science. These Subject Matter Experts have studied at Stanford University and worked in the Silicon Valley for decades. Apart from these, STEMStart! has also partnered with the Los Altos County Library and Palo Alto Library for providing the large rooms (free of cost) for executing these workshops. 
 
 The workshops were able to gain a good amount of participants (241 participants over 8 workshops). STEMStart! has fostered an enriching STEM learning experience for the participants, instilling scientific thinking, nurturing  intellectual curiosity, and shedding light on potential careers. The non-profit has helped participants identify and carry forward their passions in STEM, with workshop themes, hands-on activities, and 1:1 guidance that were tailored to the participantsâ€™ age group, knowledge and interests. 

STEMStart! recently won the <a href="https://pacsky.org/scouting/eagles-nest/adams-award-winners/">2024 Glenn A. and Melinda W. Adams Eagle Scout Service Project of the Year Award</a>.
