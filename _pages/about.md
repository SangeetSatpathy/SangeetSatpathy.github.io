<br>

I aspire to become an engineer leveraging my electronics, engineering, robotics, math, physics, chemistry and programming skills to solve real world problems. I am proficient in several programming languages. In addition, I have excellent problem-solving skills, deep conceptual understanding of sciences and a high level of analytical and mathematical skills. 


I have the ability to generate a plan dissecting pros and cons and develop innovative ideas using my creativity. I have good presentation and public speaking skills and present information in an organized manner that serves the purpose of the message, context, and audience. I actively listen to understand and ask clarifying questions. 


I can stay calm, clear-headed, and unflappable under stress. Moreover, I bring a strong sense of ownership and high level of perseverance to my activities with a sound awareness of social and ethical situations. These traits have helped me work with various age groups and have made me a respected leader in my school, local community and Boy Scout troop.

I have also been a competitive swimmer from 2010 to 2020 -- first at Nisha Millets Swim Academy at Bangalore, then at Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics, and finally at Alto Swim Club. This fed into my obsession of traversing water, whatever the means be. I love the sound of the water rippling, whether it be when I am ocean kayaking, canoeing, white water rafting, small boat sailing, swimming, or diving (I'm even PADI certified for Open Water Diving!). At this point, I have visited almost every beach along the California coast.

My name, Sangeet, means "music" in Hindi. True to my name, my mind is filled with songs across genres.  I love mixing tunes across different cultures and eras. Back in middle school, I played the violin and trombone.
