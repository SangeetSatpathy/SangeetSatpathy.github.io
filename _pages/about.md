<br>

I aspire to become an engineer leveraging my electronics, engineering, robotics, math, physics, chemistry and programming skills. I am proficient in several programming languages. In addition, I have excellent problem-solving skills, deep conceptual understanding of sciences and a high level of analytical and mathematical skills. 


I have the ability to generate a plan dissecting pros and cons and develop innovative ideas using my creativity. I have good presentation and public speaking skills and present information in an organized manner that serves the purpose of the message, context, and audience. I actively listen to understand and ask clarifying questions. 


I can stay calm, clear-headed, and unflappable under stress. Moreover, I bring a strong sense of ownership and high level of perseverance to my activities with a sound awareness of social and ethical situations. These traits have helped me be a respected leader in my school, local community and Boy Scout troop.
