I aspire to become an engineer leveraging my electronics, engineering, robotics, math, physics, chemistry  and programming skills. I am also proficient in several programming languages. I have excellent problem-solving skills, deep conceptual understanding of sciences and a high level of analytical and mathematical skills. I have the ability to generate a plan dissecting pros and cons and develop innovative ideas using my creativity. I have good presentation and public speaking skills. I bring a strong sense of ownership and high level of perseverance to my activities. These traits have helped me be a respected leader in my school, local community and Boy Scout troop.
