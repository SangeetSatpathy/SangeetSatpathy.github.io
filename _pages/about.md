My name, Sangeet, means "music" in Hindi. True to my name, my mind is filled with songs across genres.  I love mixing tunes across different cultures and eras. Back in elementary and middle school, I played the violin and trombone.

I aspire to become an engineer leveraging my electronics, engineering, robotics, math, physics, chemistry and programming skills to solve real world problems. I am proficient in several programming languages. In addition, I have excellent problem-solving skills, deep conceptual understanding of sciences and a high level of analytical and mathematical skills.Â 

I have also been a competitive swimmer from 2010 to 2020 -- first at Nisha Millets Swim Academy at Bangalore, then at Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics, and finally at Alto Swim Club. This fed into my fascination of traversing water, whatever the means be. I love the sound of the water rippling, whether it be when I am ocean kayaking, canoeing, white water rafting, small boat sailing, swimming, or diving (I'm even PADI certified for Open Water Diving!). At this point, I have visited almost every beach along the California coast.
