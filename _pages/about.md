While my name Sangeet--which means music in Sanskrit--did not turn me into a musical genius, I grew up in a household appreciative of music. My parents brought me up listening to Indian music, be it classical, folk, Bollywood, or religious sermons. From my sister’s loud tween and teen years, I listened to sweetheart pop, alternative music, and rock. I grew up gravitating towards R&B and Bollywood beats as my go-to music, and had fun mixing tunes across genres and cultures. As the house musician, I also played the trombone and violin in elementary and middle school. 

However, rather than music, I was unconsciously drawn to the other kinds of waves. As I grew up, I found myself exploring the sine waves in trigonometry, doing experiments with light waves in chemistry, and learning about quantum mechanical waves in physics. Building confidence from these building blocks, I then took on challenges in electronics, engineering, and robotics across coursework, internships, projects, and research. I also have gained proficiency in several programming languages. Today, I aspire to become an electrical engineer, leveraging all these skills to solve real world problems. 

Outside of abstract and modeled waves, I spend my free time in actual waves. I was a competitive swimmer from 2010 to 2020 – first at Nisha Millets Swim Academy at Bangalore, then at Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics, and finally at Alto Swim Club. A day out on the water is always invigorating, be it when I am ocean kayaking, canoeing, whitewater rafting, small boat sailing, swimming, or diving (I’m even PADI certified for Open Water Diving!). At this point, I have visited nearly every beach along the California coast.
